# 📚 Case Study: Strengthening Fraud Detection Through Synthetic Data Generation

### ✅ Scenario
A financial institution experiences rising fraud losses but faces a major problem:  
fraudulent transactions account for **less than 1%** of total activity.

This extreme imbalance causes the existing fraud model to:

- Miss rare fraud patterns  
- Overfit to normal transactions  
- Show high accuracy but very low fraud recall  
- Fail to identify sophisticated fraud in real time  

The institution needs a safe way to **increase fraud representation** without exposing customer data.

A GAN-based synthetic fraud generator is deployed to solve the imbalance problem.

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Understanding the Imbalance Problem
The dataset includes hundreds of thousands of legitimate transactions but only a few hundred fraud cases.  
This leads to:

- Poor model generalization  
- High false-negative rate  
- Little visibility into fraud-specific behavior  

A GAN is selected because it can create **new, realistic fraud samples** without leaking sensitive details.

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Training the GAN to Simulate Fraud
The team develops an adversarial GAN architecture:

- **Generator** — creates synthetic fraudulent transactions  
- **Discriminator** — evaluates whether a transaction is real or synthetic  

After iterative adversarial training, the generator produces synthetic fraud that mirrors the statistical structure of real fraud cases without copying them.

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Validating Synthetic Fraud Quality
The synthetic samples undergo multiple quality checks:

- PCA visual comparison  
- Feature distribution alignment  
- Variance and anomaly pattern checks  

**Results:**
- Synthetic fraud points overlap real fraud clusters  
- Histogram differences remain minimal  
- Fraud-only behavior becomes clearer  
- No mode collapse detected  

The synthetic dataset is approved for use in model retraining.

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Retraining the Fraud Detection Model
The fraud model is retrained using:

- Original real transaction data  
- Synthetic fraudulent samples generated by the GAN  

After retraining:

- Fraud recall improves by **28–35%**  
- False negatives drop sharply  
- Model becomes more robust to unseen fraud patterns  
- Decision thresholds can be tightened with more confidence  

The bank now catches more fraud **without increasing false alarms**.

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Outcome
Within the next reporting cycle:

- Fraud detection accuracy increases  
- Losses from undetected fraud decline  
- Investigators receive cleaner, more accurate alerts  
- Synthetic data becomes part of a scalable fraud-testing framework  

The GAN solution enables the bank to enhance fraud prevention without collecting additional sensitive data.
